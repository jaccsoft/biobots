# biobots
Web application using Laravel PHP framework 5.0 (php version 5.4) to build a tool for Biobots customers and internal team to analyze print information and results.

For an easy review: This app was deployed at: http://codedition.com/biobotapp/public/ I have created a quick intro video (it has audio) in the homepage explaining what you should expect after clicking the "Analyze Data Now" button under the video player. This button will take you to a functional demo of the app

Important thoughts (Problems vs solutions): Provide the best way to analyze large data sets. This app should display graphics of all the values in the Database. It's also a good practice to quickly identify the minimum, maximum and averages values of large data sets. Use graphics, research about the best way to display the data in an easy but appealing visual way. I have created an "ideation" folder in the root where you will find images related to how I started to think about the requested challenge. There are also some layouts that I don't expect them to be considered for the "World best web design magazine" :)

Technology: 1. PHP 5.4 2. jQuery 3. Bootstrap 3. Laravel Framework 5.0
